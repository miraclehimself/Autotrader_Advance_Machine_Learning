# Autotrader_Advance_Machine_Learning
Tasked with creating a regression model to predict car selling prices based on historical data. I performed tasks such as data preparation, feature engineering, model selection, tuning, ensembling, and evaluation. 
The assignment requires a structured report with code explanations and a fully-documented, reproducible Python notebook. The dataset is provided by AutoTrader and contains car sale adverts. I processed, explore, and analyze the data, build and evaluate regression models, and discuss insights from the results. The assignment assesses aspects like correctness, clarity, and usefulness of code/explanations.
